Ever since first attending the [MIT Mystery Hunt](https://puzzles.mit.edu/index.html) in 2020, I've been fascinated about the kinds of things that people come up with when making puzzles, and I wanted to do the same! I try and learn something (or teach something I think is interesting) with each puzzle I create, and try and allow automated answer checking and hinting with an AWS Lambda API running off of my site.

Since this repository is public, I try to avoid anything that would be a hint for any given puzzle in the code itself, so your best bet if interested is to visit my site and [try them out](https://spencer.carvers.info/puzzles)!

(This is not a puzzle)
