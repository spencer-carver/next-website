This repository houses the code running my personal website at https://spencer.carvers.info. I plan to use it to showcase my prefered coding styles, and also to keep learning about the latest JS and Front-End development trends.

## About
### Code
This codebase uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and [Stitches](https://stitches.dev/). It uses Next's static HTML export functionality to generate the files hosted in s3 which comprises the accessible portion of my site.

If you're interested in the previous version of this site, it is available [here](https://github.com/spencer-carver/website).
