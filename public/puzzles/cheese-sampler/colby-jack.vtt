I want some Colby Jack.

This blend of cheeses is just where it's at.

When it's my treat, baby I'll behave

00:00:39.212 --> 00:00:42.982
This mixed up cheese, the only thing I crave.

00:00:43.551 --> 00:00:46.976
It's just that no food makes me feel this way.

00:00:48.031 --> 00:00:49.475
