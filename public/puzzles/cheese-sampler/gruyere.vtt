00:00:01.521 --> 00:00:05.480
I've seen a lot of cheese<br>and travelled many miles

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:09.519
Inspected many wheels<br>and tried my share of styles.

00:00:09.557 --> 00:00:12.991
I've pursued the greatest flavor<br>through one too many tries.

00:00:13.189 --> 00:00:16.441
and now I sit here happy<br>thinking it's my time to die.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.981
So what if all my arteries<br>were blocked or barely there?

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:22.981
The Gruyere was so fantastic<br>I hardly ever cared!

00:00:23.181 --> 00:00:25.961
I'm having trouble breathing<br>and I'm laying on the floor.

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:29.166
Thinking to myself<br>as the police break down the door

00:00:29.364 --> 00:00:32.336
I get loaded on a stretcher<br>so that they can get me out

00:00:32.564 --> 00:00:35.406
They have to load me carefully<br>to avoid my case of gout.

00:00:35.606 --> 00:00:38.776
I grab my bag of must-haves<br>as they take me out the room.

00:00:38.975 --> 00:00:42.029
I cannot be without them<br>if this really is my doom.

00:00:48.488 --> 00:00:51.499
So what if all my arteries<br>are filled with cholesterol?

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:54.810
I still love this cheese<br>and so I don't quite care at alll

00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:57.920
The neighbors come to gawk<br>as they bring me down the stairs

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:00.690
Accusing me of gluttony<br>as though they've ever cared

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.969
With a backup group of responders<br>they load me up for good

00:01:04.168 --> 00:01:06.999
I sit back in the ambulance<br>as I get a breathing hood

00:01:07.068 --> 00:01:10.399
But I turn down the assistance,<br>no longer having trouble breathing

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:13.727
and I thank them for their efforts<br>but it's time I best be leaving.

00:01:16.526 --> 00:01:20.477
I may have ate a metric ton of cheese<br>from all around the world

00:01:20.676 --> 00:01:23.997
Even the sketchiest varieties<br>I never had to hurl

00:01:24.486 --> 00:01:27.484
Even on my deathbed<br>I'll have one final trial

00:01:27.683 --> 00:01:30.994
A single piece of perfect cheese<br>Gruyere is just my style!

00:01:31.194 --> 00:01:34.484
So as you listen to my tale<br>hear what it's all about

00:01:34.683 --> 00:01:37.984
Pursuing cheese, my happiness,<br>until my lights go out

00:01:38.523 --> 00:01:41.379
Even on my deathbed<br>I'll have one final trial

00:01:42.018 --> 00:01:45.091
A single piece of perfect cheese,<br>Gruyere is just my style!
