00:00:07.961 --> 00:00:10.990
I remember when we stocked up, the first time

00:00:11.029 --> 00:00:13.465
Saying "This is it we have enough". Cuz like

00:00:13.513 --> 00:00:16.145
We bought enough cheese for a month. And we're

00:00:16.204 --> 00:00:18.985
running out of space. Well

00:00:19.064 --> 00:00:21.815
Then you come around again and say, "Baby,

00:00:22.015 --> 00:00:24.671
It's not enough we have to make a change, let's go

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:27.331
get an extra fridge installed today." I say

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:30.161
"That's crazy. Let's do it." we do it. It's awesome.

00:00:30.321 --> 00:00:32.661
OooooOOOoooohhhh

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.523
We bought 2 blocks again last night.

00:00:35.722 --> 00:00:38.213
OooooOOOoooohhhh

00:00:38.412 --> 00:00:41.494
This time, I'm telling you<br>I'm telling you

00:00:41.694 --> 00:00:47.004
We are never ever ever running out of Cheddar.

00:00:47.204 --> 00:00:52.489
We are never ever ever running out of Cheddar.

00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:54.519
We'll buy some from Whole Foods

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:57.506
Some from TJs<br>get some free.

00:00:58.515 --> 00:01:04.513
We are never ever ever ever running out of Cheddar.

00:01:05.962 --> 00:01:07.943
Like, ever.

00:01:09.012 --> 00:01:12.047
Not really going to miss that creeping fright, that we

00:01:12.135 --> 00:01:14.757
run out in the middle of the night, and you

00:01:14.956 --> 00:01:17.467
panic drown your sorrows in wine, cuz we

00:01:17.667 --> 00:01:20.277
ran out of the one thing that lets us be fine.

00:01:20.477 --> 00:01:23.126
OooooOOOoooohhhh

00:01:23.325 --> 00:01:25.976
We bought 2 blocks again last night

00:01:26.176 --> 00:01:28.475
OooooOOOoooohhhh

00:01:28.674 --> 00:01:31.646
This time, I'm telling you<br>I'm telling you

00:01:31.846 --> 00:01:37.017
