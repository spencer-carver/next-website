00:00:03.231 --> 00:00:06.459
How the heck did it end up like this?

00:00:07.078 --> 00:00:08.949
Why weren't we able

00:00:09.048 --> 00:00:12.430
to grate this cheese into a fine mist

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:14.929
to put on the table

00:00:15.128 --> 00:00:20.960
I wish we had better cheese<br>to use for flavor

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:26.996
Shopping should be simple, a breeze<br>so do me a favor

00:00:27.195 --> 00:00:28.246
Something small

00:00:28.445 --> 00:00:32.466
Just as long as you know<br>what kinds to buy

00:00:32.665 --> 00:00:38.489
Someday, somehow<br>I'll go out and shop but not right now

00:00:38.689 --> 00:00:43.979
Just get me the perfect Parmesan<br>(Parmigiano Reggiano)

00:00:44.179 --> 00:00:50.478
Someday, somehow<br>I'll go out and shop but not right now

00:00:50.677 --> 00:00:54.468
Just get me the perfect Parmesan

00:00:56.027 --> 00:00:59.470
Well I'd hope that since you're there anyway

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.960
It wouldn't be a bother

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:05.140
Today is your planned shopping day

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.939
you always go with your daughter

00:01:08.018 --> 00:01:10.990
[The] store is really not far away

00:01:12.018 --> 00:01:13.675
you'll be back before lunchtime

00:01:13.885 --> 00:01:16.475
Now there's really not much to say

00:01:17.493 --> 00:01:19.945
Go it's crunch-time

00:01:20.014 --> 00:01:21.415
Something small

00:01:21.503 --> 00:01:24.980
Just as long as you know<br>what kind to buy

00:01:32.018 --> 00:01:37.507
Just get me the perfect Parmesan<br>(Parmigiano Reggiano)

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:31.481
Someday, somehow<br>I'll go out and shop but not right now

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.450
Someday, somehow<br>I'll go out and shop but not right now

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.980
Just get me the perfect Parmesan
